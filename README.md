I would like to utilize my computer science knowledge and skills in my future workplace as well as to grow as a professional, collaborating with others and learning more ever day.  
  
### Educational Game Application in hackathon
Oct 2022 - Oct 2022  
Development of a game using genetic algorithms for the combination of characteristics of organisms in space.  
First place national winning team of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2022.  
On October 1st and 2nd, 2022, I participated in the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2022 hackathon in the Adaptation Heroes team.  
Our group was the first place winner for Costa Rica being part of the global nominees for this event.
